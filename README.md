# Iris Classification with SVM and TensorFlow

This project is an **adaptation of a previous machine learning assignment**, expanded to include a **TensorFlow-based neural network model** in addition to the original **Scikit-learn SVM** implementation. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, visualization, training, and evaluation on the classic **Iris flower dataset**.

***

### Overview

The purpose of this project is to explore two different approaches to classifying the Iris dataset:

- A **traditional SVM (Support Vector Machine)** classifier using Scikit-learn  
- A **feed-forward neural network** implemented with TensorFlow’s Keras API  

The project allows comparison between conventional machine learning methods and simple deep learning models on the same dataset.

***

### Features

- Loads and visualizes the Iris dataset using **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**
- Standardizes numeric features using **StandardScaler**
- Implements and evaluates an **SVM classifier** with accuracy and confusion matrix reports
- Builds and trains a **neural network model** in TensorFlow for classification
- Compares model performance between classical and deep learning methods

***

### Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**

***

### Data

The **Iris dataset** is a well-known benchmark dataset in machine learning. It contains measurements of 150 iris flowers from three species:

- *Iris setosa*
- *Iris versicolor*
- *Iris virginica*

Each sample includes four features:
- Sepal length  
- Sepal width  
- Petal length  
- Petal width  

***

### How to Run

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
   ```

2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python iris_classification_tf.py
   ```

3. **Expected outputs:**
   - A scatter matrix visualization of the dataset
   - SVM model accuracy and classification report
   - Neural network training output and accuracy evaluation

***

### Results

The assignment extension demonstrates that:
- The **SVM model** achieves reliable baseline accuracy using a few lines of Scikit-learn code.  
- The **neural network** implemented in TensorFlow can achieve similar or improved performance through multiple training epochs.  

This adaptation highlights the flexibility of Python’s machine learning ecosystem and how traditional and neural approaches can complement one another.

Would you like me to add a “Project Structure” section describing the file layout (e.g., `iris_classification_tf.py`, `requirements.txt`)?
